# rock-paper-scissors

The purpose of this project is to create a simple rock, paper,
scissors game playable in the browser in order to solidify my 
knowledge of JavaScript.

The game is played in the JavaScript console in a browser. In
order to play the game, open the console and invoke the playGame
function. You will be prompted for your choice of rock, paper,
or scissors over five rounds. The winner will be written to the
console after each round and at the end of the game after all
five rounds are played.
