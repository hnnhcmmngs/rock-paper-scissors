# rock-paper-scissors

The purpose of this project is to create a simple rock, paper,
scissors game playable on the webpage in order to solidify my 
knowledge of JavaScript.

The game allows the player to choose between rock, paper, and
scissors. A random value is chosen as the computer's choice. After
each round of the game, the player's or computer's score is updated
depending on who wins and the winner of the round is displayed. A
game lasts for five rounds. After the five rounds, a game over
message is displayed that tells the player if they won or lost and
there is the option to reset the webpage and play a new game.
